            <h2>Other</h2>
            Made using mineflayer.

            <h2>Features</h2>

            <h3>Discord chat bridge</h3>

            The bot has full support in discord for cross chatting and running commands!
            <br>
            <img width="524" height="821" alt="image" src="i1.png" />

            <h3>Advanced player database system</h3>

            The bot uses sqlite3 to store all kinds of player statistics and messages.
            <br>
            <img width="674" height="569" alt="image" src="i2.png" />

            <h3>Message Queuing</h3>

            The bot will queue up messages so all messages can go through and the bot won't get kicked for spam.

            <h3>Discord Message Grouping</h3>

            The bot automatically groups up messages (up to 10 embeds per message) to avoid getting rate limited by discord with lots of chat messages
            <br>
            <img width="940" height="526" alt="image" src="i3.gif" />

            <h3>Anti anti spam</h3>

            The bot will automatically retry messages that fail to send after a few seconds.
            <br>
            <img width="964" height="186" alt="image" src="i4.png" />

            <h3>Death messages</h3>

            The bot will automatically save kill and death messages without requiring a regex statement. This works by checking for
            usernames in the message. Use OppositeDeathMessages if the killer comes first

            <h3>Advanced regex system</h3>

            The bot includes an advanced configurable regex system for custom chat regexes if the default doesn't suit your needs.

            <h3>Server pinger</h3>

            The bot will automatically ping the server every 3 secs before joining to make sure it's online, has more than 0 players
            online in case the main server is down, and avoids constant logins.
            <br>
            <img width="412" height="345" alt="image" src="i5.png" />

            <h3>Full message logging</h3>

            Never miss a message with a full logging system. The bot will automatically log messages and join/leave msgs and
            automatically compress log files to save space.
            <br>
            <img width="1039" height="709" alt="image" src="i6.png" />

            <h3>Automatic TPA</h3>

            The bot will automatically accept TPA requests.

            <h3>Nickname detection</h3>

            When enabled the bot will automatically run /realname USERNAME for any nicknamed players.

            <h3>UUID Caching</h3>

            UUIDs are cached to a database and recached after 35 days to avoid hammering the Mojang API (Minecraft usernames are
            locked for 37 days before they can be taken)

            <h3>Advanced offline messaging system</h3>

            All players have their own mailbox and other players are able to send them messages while they are offline so they can
            recieve it once they go back online. The author will also receive an offline message back letting them know the message was received.
